Built-In Test	There are two stages of Built-In Tests (BIT) for the DPU.  The Stage 1 BIT is included in the Bootstrap program and consists of Central Processing Unit (CPU) BIT, and Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) BIT.  The Stage 2 BIT is executed after the operating system is booted and is not part of the Bootstrap program.
