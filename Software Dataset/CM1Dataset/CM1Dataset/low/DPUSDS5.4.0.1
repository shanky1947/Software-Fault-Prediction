Error Detection and Correction CSC	The Error Detection and Correction (EDAC) CSC is a Level 1 reuse component from the SSFF and INSTRUMENT Y projects.  The EDAC CSC consists of a set of Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs) and a Memory Scrubber Task.  The design of the INSTRUMENT Y EDAC CSC is described in document CIDPSDS-01.The only design change was to add logic to check for excessive external (SCM) EDAC interrupts.
