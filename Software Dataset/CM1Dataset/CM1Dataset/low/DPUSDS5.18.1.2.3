Receiving Commands from the ICU	The interface to the ICU is via a synchronous serial interface (SSI) bus, which utilizes an inter-block gap (IBG) to delineate complete messages from one another.  The DPU hardware produces an interrupt when it detects an IBG, and the SSI Driver provides a mechanism by which an application can install an interrupt hook routine to respond to an IBG interrupt.  Upon initialization, the ICUI CSC installs a hook routine into the SSI Driver called icuiCommandReceiveISR(), which verifies the checksum of an incoming command, transmits an ACK/NAK message to the ICU, and then enqueues the command for later processing by calling ccmCmdEnq().
