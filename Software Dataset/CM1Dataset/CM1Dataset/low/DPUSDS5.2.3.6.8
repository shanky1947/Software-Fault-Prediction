Install Exception Handlers 	Certain conditions can cause the VxWorks? exception handler to reboot the DPU.  These conditions include a Data Storage Interrupt from within an interrupt context, a Multiple-Bit Error (MBE), and a deferred-work queue overrun.  Under these circumstances, interrupting devices on the Company X Communication/Memory Module must be stopped prior to jumping back to the Bootstrap.  This can be done by installing a hook routine to perform the cleanup in sysHwInit() using the function rebootHookAdd().  However, to avoid the need to cleanup interrupts, an exception handler is installed which forces a watchdog reset, which will effectively clean up the pending interrupt problem.  The exception hook saves the contents of the Exception Stack Frame to EEPROM and waits for a watchdog timeout.  The following call is added to the usrRoot() function in usrConfig.c:
