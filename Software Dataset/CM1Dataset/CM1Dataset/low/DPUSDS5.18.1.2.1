Sending Messages to the ICU	In order to send messages to the ICU, the DPU FSW tasks call icuiEnq().  The calling application passes the function code of the message to be sent, as well as a pointer to a data structure containing the message parameters associated with the given function code.  The icuiEnq() function formats the message according to the ICU/DPU ICD using icuiMsgFormat(), and then writes the message to SSI Driver transmitter buffer by calling the driver write() function. A mutual exclusion semaphore, icuiSemWrite, protects the SSI Driver from being written by multiple tasks simultaneously.  A timeout parameter lets the caller control how long it is willing to block on this semaphore if there is an access conflict.
