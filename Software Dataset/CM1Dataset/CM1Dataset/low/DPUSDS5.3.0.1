Built-In Test CSC	The Built-In Test (BIT) CSC is a Level 2 reuse component from the SSFF and INSTRUMENT Y projects.  The detailed design of the BIT CSC follows. The Built-In Tests CSC, identified DPU-BIT, performs the Stage 2 Built-In Tests (BIT).  The Stage 2 BIT includes a test of the SCM EDAC circuit, a checksum test on SCM PROM, a MIL-STD-1553B internal BIT, and a memory test of the DCI Data Buffers. The results of the BIT are recorded in the SYS_CNFG_AREA in EEPROM and are also maintained in DRAM.  If an error occurs in one of the functions performing the BIT, the test result will be reported as a failure in the test itself.
