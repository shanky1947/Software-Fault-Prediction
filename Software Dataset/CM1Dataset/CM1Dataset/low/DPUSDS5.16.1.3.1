Time Retrieval	The DPU maintains a local copy of the spacecraft clock and current UT Delta in order that the DPU FSW can timestamp data products and packets.  The TIS CSC provides a function, tisTimeGet(), which retrieves a copy of both the current DPU clock value and the most recent UT Delta value.  Time is communicated among DPU FSW applications via the TIS_TIME data structure.
