 Startup Sequence	The DPU FSW is booted using PROM-resident bootstrap software.  The bootstrap software performs a basic set of built-in tests, then copies the DPU FSW from EEPROM to DRAM and executes it.  In flight, there are two methods which can trigger the DPU FSW to boot:* power-on (cold boot), or* watchdog reset (warm boot, commanded reboot).
