Time Interface Configuration	The bits to control the behavior of the DPU clock hardware were included in the DCI interface control/status register (CSR).  This presents some opportunity for a mutual exclusion problem in the event these configuration settings are altered after startup.  However, once initialized, both configuration settings are not expected to be altered.  If they are, the DPU should be put into a mode whereby the DCI interface is quiescent.
