Sending Messages to the ICU	Some special processing and checking is required in this function to handle the transmission of the ACK/NAK message.  When a command arrives from the ICU, the icuiCmdReceiveISR() will verify the message checksum and then send an ACK/NAK message to the ICU.  It is possible that an application is in the midst of sending a message to the ICU at the time a command interrupt occurs.  However, since it is not possible for an ISR to take a semaphore, an additional mechanism is required in order to provide mutual exclusion between a task an the ISR.  To accommodate this problem, the icuiEnq() function first determines whether it is being invoked from interrupt context.  If so, it then tests the value of a static variable, icuiEnqBusy.  If the variable is set, the function will save the given ACK/NAK message parameters in static variables and return.  If the variable is not set, the function will continue as normal (avoiding the semTake() and semGive() calls).  In normal execution, the icuiEnqBusy variable is set on entry and negated on exit, after which the static variables containing the ACK/NAK message parameters will be checked to determine whether an ACK/NAK is pending.
