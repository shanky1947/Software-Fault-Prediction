Synchronous Serial Interface Driver CSC	The Synchronous Serial Interface (SSI) Driver CSC is a new driver which provides an application layer interface to the SSI hardware.  The SSI Driver CSC is implemented on top of the VxWorks™ tyLib library to manage its ring buffers.   The driver features a standard I/O interface which utilizes an extended ioctl() command set to support unique SSI hardware attributes.  This driver is patterned after the older VxWorks® 5.2 serial driver architecture rather than the newer Tornado serial driver architecture due to the lack of programmer control over I/O in the newer Tornado driver architecture.
