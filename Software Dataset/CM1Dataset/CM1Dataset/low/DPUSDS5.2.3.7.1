Exclude Failed DRAM	The Bootstrap performs a memory test before loading the operating system.  The results of this test are stored in the EEPROM.  The DPU-RTOS uses the results of the memory test to exclude memory segments with bit errors from the system memory pool. The Bootstrap constructs a bit map which effectively implements a list of failed memory blocks during the bootstrap built-in test.  A set of functions have been created to utilize this  bit map to exclude failed memory blocks from the VxWorks® system memory pool.  The system memory pool is used by VxWorks® to allocate memory dynamically.  In addition, a linked list of good memory segments is created for use by the EDAC Memory Scrubber.  These functions are called from the usrInit() and usrRoot() functions in usrConfig.c.  The dramInit() function must be called prior to kernelInit() in usrInit().  The dramBuildMemPool() function is called just prior to initialization of filesystems and drivers in usrRoot().
