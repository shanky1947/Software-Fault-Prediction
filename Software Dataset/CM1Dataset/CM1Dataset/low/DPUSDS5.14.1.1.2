Initialization	 The task invokes the initialization function scuiInit() which sets an instance variable, allocates ring buffers and semaphores for the Low and High Priority Telemetry Queues, initializes a buffer and semaphore for pending “RT-RT” command messages, creates the scuiTask() wakeup semaphore, initializes internal data structures, opens and initializes file descriptors for each of the required MIL-STD-1553 subaddresses and installs ISRs.  When the CCM CSC spawns the scuiTask(), it will block on a semaphore (ccmSemScuiSpawn) awaiting SCUI initialization.  Once initialization is complete, the SCUI CSC will signal successful initialization by giving the semaphore, and then write an empty STPDU to the 1553 shared memory.
