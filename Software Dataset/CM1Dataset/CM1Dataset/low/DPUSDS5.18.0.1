Instrument Control Unit Interface CSC	The Instrument Control Unit Interface (ICUI) CSC is a new component that provides support for application-level communication with the INSTRUMENT X ICU.  The ICUI CSC is primarily responsible for implementing the application protocol with the ICU as defined in document DPUICD-01. In order to meet these objectives, ICUI provides: * An ICU Interface Message Send Function, icuiEnq(), which provides an API by which other CSCs can send messages to the ICU.* An ICU Interface Command Reader ISR, icuiCmdReceiveISR(), which receives Telecommands from the ICU and forwards them to the Command and Control Task for processing.* An ICU Interface Housekeeping Function, icuiHkGet(), which gathers ICU Interface housekeeping data at the request of the Command and Control Task.
