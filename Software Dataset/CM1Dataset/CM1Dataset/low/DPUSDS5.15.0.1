Data Compression CSC	The Data Compression (DCX) CSC was projected to be a Level 2 reuse component from the INSTRUMENT Y project at planning time.  However, an alternate algorithm used on the XMM-OM project was benchmarked against the INSTRUMENT Y algorithm, and based on those benchmarks the XMM-OM algorithm was selected instead.  As a result, the DCX CSC is now classified as a Level 3 reuse component, and will consist of some compression queue management code reused from INSTRUMENT Y, with compression algorithm code reused from XMM-OM. The Data Compression CSC consists of a Data Compression Task, dcxTask(), which accepts Data Packages from the DPA CSC via the dcxEnq() function, compresses them using the Variable Block Tiered Word Length (VBTWL) algorithm, and provides the compressed Data Package to the SCU Interface Data Processor Task
