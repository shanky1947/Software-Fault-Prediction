Transmit Message Mode(FIOSSIBGTXMSGENABLE) and Inter-Block Gap interrupts	The SSI Driver CSC supports a message mode to facilitate application level communication.  This mode uses the Inter-Block Gap interrupt generated by the hardware to synchronize message transmission. When in a messaging mode, the driver enables an internal Byte Count queue provides a synchronization mechanism for sending messages.  This Byte Count queue is updated with the message size as Inter-Block Gap interrupts are received. The Transmit Message Mode uses the BGTX interrupt, the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt, the write() call, and an internal Byte Count queue to synchronize the transmission of messages over SSI.  In this mode, the maxBytes parameter passed to write() is enqueued to the Byte Count queue.  When a period of time equal to or greater than the Interblock Gap time has expired, the BGTX interrupt will be asserted.  At this time, the driver will respond and initiate a new transfer by setting a Byte Transfer Limit for this block and enabling the Tx FIFO Empty Interrupt.  The Byte Transfer Limit corresponds to the entry on the Byte Count queue.  When all bytes in the current block have been sent up to the Byte Transfer Limit, the Tx FIFO ISR will disable itself and reset the Byte Transfer Limit to zero. An application may use this mode by calling write() with a buffer pointer and maxBytes in order to transfer a message of a particular length.
