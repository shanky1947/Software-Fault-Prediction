Public Functions	Sets the poll rate and buffer rate to the given values.  If the values are out of range, the prior values are retained and an error is reported.  The scuiTask() semaphore timeout (scuiTaskTimeout) is automatically adjusted based on the given poll rate, by setting the timeout to approximately ½ the poll rate (not that the timeout is expressed in clock ticks, and so the resolution is low and only approximates ½ of the poll rate).
