Data Processing	Data requiring compression is received via the dcxEnq() function, which has an API definition which matches the scuiEnq() API.  The DCX CSC handles the PKG_CTRL flags as described below:* PKG_COMPRESS – this flag is set to indicate if the package is actually compressed.* PKG_PRIORITY_HIGH – this flag is ignored by the DCX CSC but is forwarded to the SCUI CSC.* PKG_SEGMENT – this flag is ignored by the DCX CSC but is forwarded to the SCUI CSC.PKG_CHECKSUM – if set, the dcxEnq() function will compute a checksum which is appended to the data, and then the flag is negated.  The checksum will be compressed with the rest of the data, so that when the data is decompressed on the ground, the checksum can be recomputed and compared to provide a good indication of whether the decompressed copy of the data matches the original data set.
