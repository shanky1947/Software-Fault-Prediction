Sending Command Messages to the Spacecraft	The Instrument/SCU interface provides a mechanism by which an Instrument can transmit a message to the SCU or another Instrument via the SCU, formatted as a CCSDS Telecommand Packet.  In this document, these messages are referred to as observatory messages.  The scuiObsMsgSend() function provides an API by which an observatory message can be transmitted to the SCU via the 1553 bus.  This function has an interface similar to scuiEnq(), except that this function attempts to write the message to the RT-RT subaddress immediately.  If the SCU has not read the prior message yet, the prior message is removed from the 1553 shared memory and replaced with the new message, and an error (S_scui_OBSMSG_LOST) is enqueued to note that the prior message may not have been received by the S/C.
