Time Interface Configuration	The TIS CSC utilizes the “manual jam” bit in the DCI CSR to indicate whether automatic time synchronization is enabled or disabled.  If automatic time synchronization is enabled, and a command is issued to manually jam the DPU clock, the command will be rejected - see tisTimeSet().
