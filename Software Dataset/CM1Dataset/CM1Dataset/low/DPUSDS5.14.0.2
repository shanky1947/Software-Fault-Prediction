SCU Interface CSC	The SCUI CSC includes the following components:* SCU Interface Task, scuiTask(), which accumulates Data Packages, converts them to CCSDS Version 1 Source Packets, forms Company X Telemetry Protocol Data Units (ST_PDUs) from the Source Packets, and transmits the ST_PDUs to the SCU via the MIL-STD-1553B Interface.  The task also outputs messages to the “RT-RT” subaddress if one is awaiting on the input queue.* SCU Telemetry Enqueue function, scuiEnq(), which is an API by which other tasks provide telemetry data packages to the scuiTask() for processing.* SCU Observatory Message Enqueue function, scuiObsMsgSend(), which is an API by which other tasks provide command messages to the scuiTask() for transmission to the SCU and/or other Instruments (referred to in the 1553 ICD at “RT-RT Commands”.* SCU Interface Telemetry Done ISR, scuiTlmDoneISR(), which informs the DPU that the SCU has completed reading the prior ST_PDU, and gives a semaphore to awaken the scuiTask() to create and post a new ST_PDU.* SCU Interface Command Reader ISR, scuiReadCmdISR(), which receives Telecommands from the SCU and forwards them to the Command and Control Task for processing.* SCU Interface Housekeeping Function, scuiHkGet(), which gathers SCU Interface housekeeping data at the request of the Command and Control Task.
