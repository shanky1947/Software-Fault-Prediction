Telemetry Output to the Spacecraft 1553 Bus	The SCUI CSC reads the Data Packages from the queues and transforms them into CCSDS Version 1 Source Packets.  These Source Packets are then packed into the STPDU for transmission to the SCU.  This processing is performed by scuiConvertToSTPDU().   The STPDU, prefixed with a Transfer Request Counter (TRC), is then written to fifteen sequential 1553 subaddresses (as described in the Company X 1553 ICD) by the function scuiWrite().
