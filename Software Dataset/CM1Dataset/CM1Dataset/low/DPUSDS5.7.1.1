Initialization	The driver is initialized by invoking the initialization function adcInit().  The function initializes the ADC_LIST_ENTRY array, sets up convenience pointers to the ADC hardware registers, and sets up the ADC multiplexer for the first conversion (otherwise the very first ADC value requires three calls to adcUpdateNext()).  The ADC Driver can be re-initialized, which will result in the values in the ADC_LIST_ENTRY array being reset to their default values.The ADC_VALUEs are A-bit data items; however the hardware contains a B-bit A/D.  The upper bits are used to indicate invalid or suspect values as follows:* At initialization, the MSbit of each of the ADC_VALUEs is set (0x8000).* If a conversion fails (i.e. the driver reads the analog value and determines that the conversion has not yet completed), the second MSbit.
