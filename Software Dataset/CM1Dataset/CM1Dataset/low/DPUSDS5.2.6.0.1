Error Recovery	Except for the modification described in Sections 5.2.3.6, no further modifications to the existing task error-handling mechanisms are required. VxWorks? uses a global mechanism for returning status codes when errors occur.  This is accomplished  by using the task variable, errno (stored in the task control block).  Most VxWorks? functions return a STATUS value.  This value can either be OK or ERROR.  If a function returns ERROR, then the errno variable must indicate a specific error code.
