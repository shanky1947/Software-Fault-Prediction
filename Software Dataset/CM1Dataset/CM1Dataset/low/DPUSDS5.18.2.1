Public Functions	This routine is used to format messages for transmission to the ICU and to place those messages on the SSI Driver Transmitter Queue. The functionCode parameter is used to create the CCSDS Packet APID and the Message Identifier (refer to document DPUICD-01).  A mutual exclusion semaphore, icuiSemWrite, protects the SSI Driver from being written by multiple tasks simultaneously.  The timeout parameter lets the caller control how long it is willing to block on this semaphore if there is an access conflict.This routine may be called at interrupt context to transmit an ACK/NAK message.  In that case, the semaphore is not taken since it is not valid to take a semaphore at interrupt context.  Refer to discussion of the design to accommodate the ACK/NAK message.
