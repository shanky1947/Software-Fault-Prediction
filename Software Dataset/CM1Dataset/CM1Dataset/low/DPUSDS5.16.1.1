Structural Design	The TIS CSC provides a library of functions to* initialize the DPU clock hardware at startup,* maintain synchronization of the DPU clock with the Spacecraft clock,* provide a function for use by other applications to retrieve the current values of the DPU clock and the UT Delta, and provide functions for use by the CCM command dispatcher to alter the configuration of the clock interface.
