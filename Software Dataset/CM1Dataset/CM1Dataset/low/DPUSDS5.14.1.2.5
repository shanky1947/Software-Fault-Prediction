Telemetry Output to the Spacecraft 1553 Bus	The SCU, which is a MIL-STD-1553 Bus Controller (BC), periodically reads the STPDU contained in the fifteen telemetry subaddresses, and then writes to the “telemetry done” subaddress.  When the “telemetry done” subaddress is written, the scuiTlmDoneISR() is called which gives a semaphore to awaken the scuiTask().  The software provides fault tolerance by automatically awaking after approximately two polling periods.  This timeout is automatically adjusted any time the SCU Poll Rate value is changed by command.
