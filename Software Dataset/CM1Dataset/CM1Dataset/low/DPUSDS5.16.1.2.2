Time Synchronization	The time contained in the Clock Message is specified to be valid on the rising edge of the next 1PPS signal.  When the DPU receives the Clock Message, the 1553 ISR calls the tisTimeSync() function, forwarding the data portion of the clock message to the TIS CSC via the TIS_CLK_MSG data structure..  The tisTimeSync() function will immediately copy the spacecraft clock value to the DPU clock hardware registers. The DPU hardware is designed to latch in the new time on the rising edge of the next 1 PPS signal (the act of writing a new time to the hardware registers “arms” the latch function in the hardware).  Once the new time is latched, the hardware automatically disables the time latch function to avoid the potential of latching in an old time at the next 1 PPS signal.			will be received within one second.  In the unlikely event a UT Delta is discarded, an event message is enqueued to ccmErrEnq() for informational purposes.
