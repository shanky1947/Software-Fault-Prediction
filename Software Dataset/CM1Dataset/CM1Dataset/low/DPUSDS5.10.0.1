EEPROM Driver CSC	The EEPROM Driver (EEPRM) CSC is a Level 1 reuse component from the SSFF and INSTRUMENT Y projects.  The EEPROM Driver CSC provides an API to the EEPROM on the SCM.  The design of the INSTRUMENT Y EEPROM Driver is described in document CIDPSDS-01.  The EEPROM Driver for the Company X DPU will be nearly identical to that used on the INSTRUMENT Y CIDP and SCU, with the exception of changes driven by hardware differences.  The design changes impact only constant #defines within the included header files.
