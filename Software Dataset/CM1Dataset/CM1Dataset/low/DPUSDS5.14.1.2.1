Transmitting Telemetry to the Spacecraft	The SCUI CSC receives telemetry as input Data Packages via queues populated by other tasks—the Science Data Processing Task, the Data Compression Task, and the Command and Control Task.  The SCUI CSC has a High Priority Queue and a Low Priority Queue.  The two queues are implemented in an identical manner with the exception that the scuiTask() gives processing preference to the High Priority Queue.  The purpose of the High Priority Queue is to provide a means by which the Parameterized Finding Chart and DPU housekeeping can be transmitted to the SCU ahead of the potentially large amounts of buffered science data.
