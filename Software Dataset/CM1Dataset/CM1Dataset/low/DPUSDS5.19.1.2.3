Channel Boundary (CB) Engineering Mode	The purpose of Channel Boundary Mode is to derive the optimum channel boundary settings from a flat field. Detector events produced in the M,N detector mode are collected and histogrammed for a commanded integration time.  The “pseudo Instrument Y” is transmitted to the ground.  Channel boundaries are derived from the Instrument Y and transmitted to the ICU and the ground.  Channel boundaries are sent by the ICU to the BPE and used in the detector event centroiding process.
