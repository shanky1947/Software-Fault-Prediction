Link and Initialize Project-Specific Device Drivers and Application Programs		Project-specific device drivers and application modules must be statically linked into the VxWorks® boot Instrument Y and initialized.  Application program tasks must be spawned when the operating system boots. Device drivers and application modules are linked into the Instrument Y by adding references to the respective object files to the MACH_EXTRAS variable in the VxWorks® Makefile.The usrRoot() function in usrConfig.c is the last function to be called by the operating system during initialization.  This function is modified to execute the BIT, initialize device drivers, and spawn the top-level application program task(s).  These initialization code segments are surrounded by #ifdef…#endif directives in order that they can be conveniently included or excluded by changing the value of the corresponding constant.  Flight defaults for these constants are set in the configAll.h file.  Temporary alteration of these defaults is typically done in $WIND_BASE/target/config/rscvme/config.h.
