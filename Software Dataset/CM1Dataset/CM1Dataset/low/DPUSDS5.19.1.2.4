Centroiding Confirmation (CC) Engineering Mode	The purpose of Centroiding Confirmation Engineering Mode is to determine the validity of derived channel boundaries. Detector events are collected and histogrammed for a commanded integration time.  The full field is divided into 8x8 sub-Instrument Ys, each of ExEcentroided (by 8) pixels.  These sub-Instrument Ys are then modulo binned to produce a set of 8x8 pixels pseudo-Instrument Ys.  The Instrument Ys are column (y axis) ordered, as are the pixels within them.  These pseudo Instrument Ys are transmitted to the ground.
