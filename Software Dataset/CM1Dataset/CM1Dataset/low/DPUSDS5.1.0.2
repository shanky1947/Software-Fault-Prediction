initial boot sequence	the initial boot sequence, identified as Boot Sequence 1.  This processing takes place when the Bootstrap executes from Programmable Read-Only Memory (PROM).  Boot Sequence 1 is composed primarily of 4 steps as follows.First, in this sequence, EEPROM is updated.  Then, CPU BIT and a portion of DRAM BIT is performed.  Next, DRAM is cleared.  Lastly, Boot Sequence 2 is copied to DRAM and executed. During this sequence, the rest of DRAM is tested if skipBit is not set.  Load parameters are put into registers r13, r14, r15 and r16.  DRAM is cleared up to memSize.  Lastly, either the DPU-RTOS or the Bootstrap Monitor is loaded and executed according to the load parameters.
