Initialization	The TIS CSC is initialized by calling the tisInit() function.  The TIS CSC does not have an associated operating system task.  The TIS CSC will initialize the DPU hardware to perform or not perform automatic time synchronization with the spacecraft as indicated by an initialization parameter passed to the tisInit() function.  There are two 1 PPS signals between the DPU and the Spacecraft (a primary and alternate);  the TIS CSC will select the active 1 PPS signal according to the parameter passed to the tisInit() function.
