Compressed VxWorks® Instrument Y	In order to conserve EEPROM memory space and ensure that the boot Instrument Y fits within a single EEPROM memory bank, the VxWorks® boot Instrument Ys are compressed.  The Instrument Y produced is capable of decompressing itself in DRAM.  The make file provided with VxWorks® does not provide the necessary make target to produce a compressed RAM-resident Instrument Y with a built-in symbol table. new target, vxWorks.st_ram.bin, is included in the VxWorks® Makefile.  This target produces a compressed RAM Instrument Y containing a symbol table, and is capable of decompressing itself in DRAM.  The new file ramInit.s contains assembly language instructions which allow the Instrument Y to decompress itself in DRAM, and is compiled and linked into the compressed target.
