Event Processing	The Event Processor Task is also responsible for creating the Finding Chart.  The Create Finding Chart Algorithm will use the Choose Guide Stars Algorithm to find the brightest stars in the finding chart Instrument Y.  The parameterized finding chart will be created by listing the X & Y detector location of each star along with a CxC pixel matrix around the star location of the intensities. The Event Processor Task will create the necessary housekeeping for the DPA.
