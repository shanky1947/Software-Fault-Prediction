Telemetry Input to the SCUI CSC	Each queue is implemented as a First-In First-Out (FIFO) buffer using the VxWorks® ring buffer library, rngLib.  The calling application provides, via scuiEnq(), the data APID and processing information, a pointer to any tertiary header data (so-called since CCSDS packets already have a secondary header) and the length of that header data, and finally a pointer to the telemetry data itself and its length.  The scuiEnq() function then enqueues a Data Package onto the appropriate queue as indicated in the PKG_CTRL field.  Data Package identification and processing information is placed in a SCUI_ENTRY data structure, which is placed on the queue first, followed by the tertiary header (if present), followed by the telemetry data itself, and optionally followed by a trailing checksum (as indicated by the PKG_CTRL field) which is computed by scuiEnq().  The purpose of allowing the calling application to provide a separate pointer to tertiary header data is to eliminate the need for the caller to first copy the tertiary header data and the telemetry data to a separate single buffer prior to calling scuiEnq(), thus saving on memory copies.
