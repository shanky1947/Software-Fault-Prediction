Initialization	The DPA CSC is initialized by spawning the tasks dpaEventTask() and dpaInstrument YTask().  After the tasks are spawned they create the needed memory buffers.  The dpaEventTask() then enters the Idle state waiting for a Mode command from the ICU.  The dpaInstrument YTask also enters the Idle state waiting to process either the Ping or Pong buffer.  The default setting for compression (on or off) is retrieved from EEPROM.
