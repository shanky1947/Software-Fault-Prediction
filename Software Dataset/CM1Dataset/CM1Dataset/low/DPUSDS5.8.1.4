Standard I/O Interface 	The write primitive does not block.  The write() primitive is managed by the tyLib function, tyWrite() when the driver is not in BGTX Message Mode.  The size of the Tx ring buffer is specified in the call to ssiDevCreate() as part of the device instantiation. This routine returns either the number of bytes written, or ERROR.
