Instrument Y Processing	An exposure starts by allowing the Event Processor task to complete the first Csecond tracking Instrument Y in the Ping buffer.  This first tracking Instrument Y is copied to the reference frame buffer.  The Choose Guide Stars function is called which tries to find guide stars in the reference frame. Bright sources in the reference frame are scanned and analyzed.  The analysis gives a number of “quality” indicators for the bright sources.  Based on these quality indicators and other global considerations such as star crowdedness, a number of guide stars, nominally 10, are selected. These star positions are saved for subsequent tracking.  Based on the user-supplied/requested window configuration and the selected guide stars, window/memory management code configures memory windows and science windows around the guide stars to store acquired raw data.  While tracking, the memory windows are shifted while obeying particular memory window restrictions.  Those restrictions are: 1) that memory windows’ bottom left corner (BLC) coordinates are multiples of A and B that memory window sizes also are multiples of 16. These restrictions are imposed due to the requirements of event centroiding.
