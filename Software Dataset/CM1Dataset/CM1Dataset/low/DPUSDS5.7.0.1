Analog to Digital Converter Driver CSC	The Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) Driver CSC is a new driver which controls and retrieves data from the ADC hardware.  The key elements of the ADC driver include:* A list (array of ADC_LIST_ENTRY) which maintains the setup information and current value (ADC_VALUE) for each of the 24 ADC values. * An API function, adcUpdateNext(), which causes a single ADC_VALUE to be updated every other call to the driver.  A value is updated every other call since each value requires a multiplexer settle time as well as an ADC conversion time.  In order to keep the driver simple, the responsibility for implementing the correct settle time and conversion time rests with the application.* An API function, adcGet(), which returns a copy of the current list of ADC_VALUEs.
