	Data Processing Algorithm CSC	The DPA CSC includes the following components:* Algorithms – o Choose Guide Stars scans the bright stars in the reference frame, chooses guide stars and sets up tracking windows around the guide stars.o Drift Correction calculates the drift offset and roll of a just-completed tracking frame relative to the reference frame. o Create Finding Chart will use the above Choose Guide Stars Algorithm to find the brightest stars in the finding chart Instrument Y then creates a list of the brightest stars and their intensities.o Derive Channel Boundaries calculates a set of channel boundaries (18 numbers - 9X, 9Y) which are used by the centroiding software in the Blue Processing Electronics (BPE) in the Telescope Module.
