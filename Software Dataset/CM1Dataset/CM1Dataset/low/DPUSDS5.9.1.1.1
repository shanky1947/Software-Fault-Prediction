Standard I/O Interface		The open(), and creat() primitives returns a unique file descriptor which is used to access a single DCI port on the Company X Communications Module.  Once the port has been opened by a running task, it cannot be opened by another running task.  The driver will return an ERROR if an application tries to open a port that has already been opened.By default, open() initializes the driver in NORMAL mode.  An ioctl call may be issued to force into TEST mode.
