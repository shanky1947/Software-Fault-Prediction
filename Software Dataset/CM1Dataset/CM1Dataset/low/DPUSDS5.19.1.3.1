Instrument Y Processing	The Instrument Y Processor Task will perform tracking by breaking the exposure up into 10-second sub-exposures which are shifted and added into a final histogrammed Instrument Y.  Tracking is performed by choosing guide stars from the first 10-second Instrument Y of an exposure.  Then in each subsequent Instrument Y, these guide stars are found and the drift is determined by comparing the two Instrument Ys. The Instrument Y is then shifted by the determined drift and added to the previous Instrument Ys in the accumulation buffer.
