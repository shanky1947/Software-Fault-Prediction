Instrument Y Processing	At the end of an exposure, the Instrument Y in the accumulation buffer is transferred to the Instrument Y data product buffer one horizontal line at a time, starting at the top of the Instrument Y to form a PROD_INSTRUMENT Y data product.  This ‘rasterized’ Instrument Y in the Instrument Y data product buffer will be enqueued for transmission to the spacecraft.
