Event Processing	If the Mode command is Instrument Y Mode, the detector events are spatially filtered to the Instrument Y window specified in the Mode command then the corresponding pixel in the Ping or Pong buffer is incremented.  If specified in the Mode command, pixels will be binned at AxA or BxB.  Also, if specified in the Mode command, a tracking frame data product will be produced for every Ping/Pong tracking frame. Instrument Y and Event Mode may be commanded simultaneously in the Mode command. If the ICU sends an XRT Position command, the Instrument Y mode and Event Mode windows will be resized to match the new window sizes in the command.
