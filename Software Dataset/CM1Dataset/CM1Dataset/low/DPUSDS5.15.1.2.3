Data Processing	When the DCX CSC compresses a data package, the given APID is incremented by one.  If the compressed copy of data is larger than original data set, the original data set will be forwarded to the SCUI CSC, an event S_dcx_UNC_USED is enqueued to ccmErrEnq(), and the APID is not incremented.  In this way, the ground systems can discern compressed packets from non-compressed packets.
