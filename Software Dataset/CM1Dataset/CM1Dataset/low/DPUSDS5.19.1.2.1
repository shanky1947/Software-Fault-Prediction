Full-Frame (FF) Engineering Mode	The purpose of Full-Frame Engineering Mode is to monitor the health of the detector to locate hot spots and dead pixels. Detector events produced in Full Frame High Resolution detector format are received and histogrammed for a commanded integration time.  The entire Instrument Y is transmitted to the ground.  This mode can use high resolution (all pixels) or low resolution imaging (BxB , DxD pixel binning).
