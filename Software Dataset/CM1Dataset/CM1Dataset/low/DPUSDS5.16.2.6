Public Functions	This routine extracts the current spacecraft time from the clock message and writes in to the hardware clock registers to be latched by the hardware at the next 1PPS signal, and maintains a copy of the UT Delta provided in the clock message.  If the UT Delta is currently being copied by an application, the UT Delta from the current message is discarded and an event is enqueued to ccmErrEnq().  If automatic time synchronization is disabled, this routine returns with no action taken. THIS ROUTINE IS INVOKED AT INTERRUPT CONTEXT.
