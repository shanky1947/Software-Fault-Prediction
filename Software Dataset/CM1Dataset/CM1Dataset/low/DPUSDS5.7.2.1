Performing Analog-to-Digital Conversions	The ADC Driver maintains an array of ADC_LIST_ENTRY data structures which contain the hardware multiplexer setup information for each of the x analog inputs, and the current value (ADC_VALUE) of each analog input.  To update a single value in the list, an application must call the update function adcUpdateNext().  The ADC hardware only has a single A/D channel, and so to perform an A/D conversion the hardware requires a multiplexer setup and corresponding settle time, as well as the normal A/D conversion time.  Therefore, it takes two calls to adcUpdateNext() to update a single value in the list.  To keep the driver simple and to avoid embedding hard waits in the driver, the application is required to implement the setup and conversion time by spacing successive calls to the adcUpdateNext() function appropriately.
