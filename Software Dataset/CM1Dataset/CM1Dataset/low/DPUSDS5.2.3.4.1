Unmask VME Interrupts and Disallow Nested Interrupts	The device drivers do not automatically unmask VME interrupts at the processor.  This must be done separately since some VME interrupts may share an IRQ level. Finally, nested interrupt capability should be disabled since allowing for nested interrupts was not considered in the design of this FSW.  This is done by verifying that SYS_INT_MASK_0 and SYS_INT_MASK_1 are both defined to 0xffffffff in config.h.
