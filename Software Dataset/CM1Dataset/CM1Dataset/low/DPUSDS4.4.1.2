 Startup Sequence 	On flight, a power cycle can only be effected by the SCU.  A watchdog reset could be induced by the DPU FSW due to a detected, unrecoverable error, or it could occur as a by-product of the FSW entering a state in which it fails to strobe the watchdog timer.  On boot, the bootstrap tests and clears DRAM, and then proceeds to load the DPU FSW from EEPROM and executes it.  The DPU FSW then loads configuration information from EEPROM (which establishes various operational defaults) and spawns the various DPU FSW tasks.
