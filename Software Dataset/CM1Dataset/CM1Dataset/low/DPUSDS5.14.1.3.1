Receiving Commands from the Spacecraft	The DPU/SCU interface specifies that commands for the DPU will be transmitted from the SCU to the DPU on a separate MIL-STD-1553 subaddress.  The SCU Interface Command Reader ISR, scuiCmdReadISR(). consists of an ISR installed on a specific MIL-STD-1553 subaddress corresponding to the command subaddress for the INSTRUMENT X DPU. This ISR is installed at initialization by scuiInit().  Upon interrupt, the scuiCmdReadISR() reads a single telecommand from the 1553 bus, checks the length and checksum, and then forwards valid commands to the Command and Control CSC for dispatch via ccmCmdEnq().  Errors are reported by incrementing an invalid command counter.
