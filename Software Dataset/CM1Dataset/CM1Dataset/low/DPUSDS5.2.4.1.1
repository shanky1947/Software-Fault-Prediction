Data Transfer Library		In order to transfer data more efficiently across the VME bus, a data transfer library is provided.  The library consists of a function which utilizes the move multiple and store multiple instructions to decrease VME data transfer time.  This library is called the “blt” library, which is short for “block transfer library”, even though the library does not technically implement VME block transfers.
