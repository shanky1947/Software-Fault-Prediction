Bootstrap CSC	The Bootstrap CSC is a Level 1 reuse component from the SSFF and INSTRUMENT Y projects. The Bootstrap for the Company X DPU will be nearly identical to that used on the INSTRUMENT Y CIDP and SCU, with the exception of minor hardware interface differences:* The interface to the hardware watchdog timer is different on the Company X DPU versus that used on the INSTRUMENT Y CIDP/SCU.* The interface to the mission elapsed time (MET) clock is different on the Company X DPU versus that used on the INSTRUMENT Y CIDP/SCU.* The INSTRUMENT Y bootstrap was able to discern a cold (power-on) boot from a warm (watchdog reset) boot by examining the value of the MET clock, which did not reset to zero on a warm boot.  The Company X DPU MET clock resets to zero on both a cold and warm boot, and so there is no distinction in the Company X bootstrap.
