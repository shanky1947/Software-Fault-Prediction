	Data Processing Algorithm CSC	The DPA CSC includes the following components:* 		Instrument Y buffers – o Ping and Pong hold the X-second tracking Instrument Ys that are shifted and added to the Accumulation Instrument Y during tracking.o  Reference holds the initial X-second exposure that the guide stars are chosen from.o Accumulation holds the final drift corrected Instrument Y.o Data Product holds the final Instrument Y that will be compressed and sent to the spacecraft.
