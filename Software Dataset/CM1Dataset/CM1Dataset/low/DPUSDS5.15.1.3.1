Compression Algorithm	The VBTWL algorithm is implemented in a set of C-language functions provided by PSU as a reuse item from the XMM-OM mission.  The algorithm is described in document XMM-OM/PENN/TC/0004.03; therefore the design of the compression algorithm code itself is outside the scope of this document.  Rather, the design of the code which “wraps” the algorithmic code is specified.  The entry point to the compression algorithm is the function vbtwl().  This function is called directly by the Data Compression Task.  The entry point for the Data Compression Task is the function dcxTask().
