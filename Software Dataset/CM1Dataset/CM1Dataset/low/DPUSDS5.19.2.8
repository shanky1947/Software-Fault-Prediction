Public Functions	This routine provides a means for the CCM to report to the DPA CSC whether to send data to the compression queue or directly to the spacecraft interface queue.  After receiving a ground command to turn compression on or off, this function is called by the ccmCmdTask to inform the DPA whether to compress its data or not.  This function will set the global variable dpa_dcx_on TRUE if compression is enabled and FALSE if not.  Dpa_dcx_on will be used by the DPA to determine whether to send data to dcxEnq() or scuiEnq().
