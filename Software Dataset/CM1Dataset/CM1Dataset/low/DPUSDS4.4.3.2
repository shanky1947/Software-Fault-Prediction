remaining DPU FSW tasks	Following startup, the Command and Control Task spawns the remaining DPU FSW tasks, which are described below:* The Command Dispatch Task (ccmCmdTask) is an Application Framework Software task which is responsible for dispatching commands which arrive from the ICU or the SCU.  Commands are executed directly by this task by calling the applicable CSC function* The SCU Interface Task (scuiDPTask) receives telemetry data from other tasks, converts them to CCSDS Version 1 Source Packets, forms Company X Telemetry Protocol Data Units (STPDUs) from the Source Packets, and transmits the STPDUs to the SCU via the MIL-STD-1553B Interface.* The Telescope Module Event Transfer Task (tmaliTask) is an Application Framework Software task which is responsible for transferring data from the DCI ping/pong buffers to the TMALI data buffer in response to a DCI frame limit or data timeout interrupt.* The Data Compression Task (dcxTask) receives telemetry data from other tasks, uses a lossless data compression algorithm to compress the data, and then enqueues the data to the SCU Interface Task.* The Data Processing Algorithms Tasks (dpaIMTask and dpaEPTask) process incoming detector events according to the commanded mode, create data products, and enqueue those data products to the Data Compression Task (if compression is enabled) or to the SCU Interface Task.* The Error Detection and Correction Memory Scrubber Task (edacTask) cycles through the text and data segments of the DPU to trigger the correction of single-bit errors which may have occurred, in order to help prevent the occurrence of uncorrectable multiple-bit errors.
