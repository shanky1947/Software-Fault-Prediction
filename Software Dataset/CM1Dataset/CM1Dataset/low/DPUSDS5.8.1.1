Standard I/O Interface		The open(), and creat() primitives return a unique file descriptor which is used to access the SSI port on the Company X Communications Module.  Once the port has been opened by a running task, it cannot be opened by another running task.  The driver will return an ERROR if an application tries to open a port that has already been opened.By default, open initializes the driver with no messaging mode set for either Rx or Tx.  The internal semaphore used to block calling applications is initialized to WAIT_FOREVER, and all event counters are set to zero.
