Instrument Y Processing	After the guide stars are chosen, the Drift Correction algorithm looks at each subsequent Ping or Pong tracking frame.  It calculates the drift offset and roll of a just-completed tracking frame relative to the reference frame. This is done by first calculating the position of the guide stars in the tracking frame. Then a maximum likelihood solution is found by comparing the positions of the guide stars calculated in the tracking frame with their position in the reference frame.  Once the translation offset has been calculated, the tracking frame is shifted by the translation offset and added to the accumulation frame, which contains the previously accumulated tracking frames.
