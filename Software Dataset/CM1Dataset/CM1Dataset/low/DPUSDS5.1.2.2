CPU BIT	The CPU BIT consists of a series of tests designed to test each of the functional units of the processor.  These include test for the Branch-Unit, the Fixed-Point Unit, the Floating-Point Unit, the Interrupt-Unit, and the Timer Unit.   Each of these tests consists of executing a few selected instructions from the this functional unit. The General Purpose Registers (GPR), the Segment Registers (SR), the Counter Register (CTR), and the Condition Register are tested for stuck-bits as part of the Branch-Unit test.  This is done by writing a 1’s pattern (verified by reading it back) and then writing a 0’s pattern (verified by reading it back).
