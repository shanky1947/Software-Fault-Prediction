Event Processing	If the Mode command is Event Mode, the detector events are spatially filtered to the event window specified in the Mode command then put into an event list in the Event Frame buffer.  Once the Event Frame Buffer fills (4MB), or 5 seconds elapses, a  PROD_EVENT data product will be produced and enqueued for transmission to the spacecraft.
