ADC Driver Functions	The function initializes the ADC_LIST_ENTRY array, sets up convenience pointers to the ADC hardware registers, and sets up the ADC multiplexer for the first conversion (otherwise the very first ADC value requires three calls to adcUpdateNext()).  The ADC Driver can be re-initialized, which will result in the values in the ADC_LIST_ENTRY array being reset to their default values.
