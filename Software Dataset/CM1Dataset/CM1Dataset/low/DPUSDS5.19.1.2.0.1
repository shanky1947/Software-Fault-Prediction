Event Processing	The Event Processor Task, after receiving a Mode command from the ICU, configures the DPU DCI hardware, responds to the ICU with a Mode Ready message then receives detector events by calling functions tmaliWait() and tmaliNextEvent().  The Event Processor Task will collect detector events for the time period specified in the Mode command then issue a Mode Complete message to the ICU.  After issuing the Mode Complete message, the Event Processor Task will enter the Idle state.
