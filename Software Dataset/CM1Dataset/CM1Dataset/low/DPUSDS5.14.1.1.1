Initialization	The SCUI CSC is initialized when the scuiTask() is spawned by the CCM CSC.  Initialization parameters which are passed into the scuiTask() include:* Poll Rate – rate at which the S/C will poll the DPU for telemetry.  The rate is specified in Hz, and has a default of X Hz based on the INSTRUMENT X-DPU poll rate in the Company X 1553 ICD.* Buffer Rate – value used to rate buffer data to the S/C.  The rate is specified in bits per telemetry poll, and has a default of 7664 which is equal to one STPDU per poll (*** bytes per STPDU times V bits/byte).  This default value effectively disables rate buffering.* Size of Low Priority Queue – size in bytes of the low priority telemetry queue.  If the amount requested cannot be allocated, the buffer will be allocated at ½ the amount of memory contained in the largest free memory block.Size of High Priority Queue – size in bytes of the high priority telemetry queue. If the amount requested cannot be allocated, the buffer will be allocated at ½ the amount of memory contained in the largest free memory block.
