Hardware Interfaces	The DPU-BOOTSTRAP must interface directly with the EEPROM on the Company X Communication Module.  The DPU-BOOTSTRAP accesses EEPROM as ?-bit words only.  The specific timing requirements of the EEPROM are satisfied in one of three ways:* the timing requirements are met by inserting specific wait loops (typical),* the timing requirements are met by use of the EEPROM Driver (DOWNLOAD command), andthe timing requirements are met implicitly by the amount of time which will be required to execute the intervening instructions regardless of the CPU speed setting (DRAM test logic).
