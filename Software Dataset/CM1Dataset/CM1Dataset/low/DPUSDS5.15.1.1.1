Initialization	The DCX CSC is initialized when the dcxTask() is spawned by the CCM CSC.  During initialization, the DCX CSC creates a compression queue to contain data packages which are pending compression.  Access to the compression queue is protected by a mutual exclusion semaphore.  The size of the compression queue is controlled by an initialization parameters which is passed into the dcxTask().  If the amount of memory requested cannot be allocated, initialization of the DCX CSC will fail.
