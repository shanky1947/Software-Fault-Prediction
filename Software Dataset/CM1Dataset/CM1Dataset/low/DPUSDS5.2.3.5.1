Setup Segment Registers	In order to access VME space as memory-mapped I/O, segment registers must be setup in VxWorks®. Modifications to four source files set up both D16 and D32 access to the VME bus.  As delivered, the VxWorks® Board Support Package (BSP) supports only one data access mode.  The syntax of the function sysVmePioSetup() in rscVme.c is extended to allow the specification of two dataWidth parameters.  The sysBusToLocalAdrs() function which maps a segment register into an address is replaced by two functions sys16BusToLocalAdrs() and sys32BusToLocalAdrs() since two segment registers are required.
