  The DPU-SSI shall provide an operational mode (Tx MESSAGE MODE) for transmitting blocks in which consecutive words in a block are transmitted,  and the transmitter is disabled until a transmit IBG interrupt is received.  At this point the transmitter is re-enabled, and the next message can be transmitted.
