  At the end of a download, the Bootstrap Monitor of the DPU-BOOT CSC shall compute a CHKS_32 on the X stored in EEPROM and compare it against the CHKS_32 sent with the X during the transfer.  The Bootstrap Monitor shall output to to the RS-232 interface both CHKS_32s and a message indicating whether the download was successful.
